# EaglercraftX Replit Archive


Hi everyone!

First, please go buy Minecraft.

Ok, done? Now we can proceed...

This repository contains a slimmed-down archive of the eaglercraftx (1.8) replit project. It is missing a few things; namely:
- eula.txt and server jar deleted from server folder
- selsrv.sh exits early, because:
- misc folder removed due to containing jars that I cannot with 100% certainty distribute

This repository **DOES NOT** contain ANYTHING that can be reasonably DMCA'd.

# EaglercraftX


#### smashed together by [ayunami2000](https://github.com/ayunami2000)
##### and [EaglercraftX](https://gitlab.com/lax1dude/eaglercraftx-1.8) developed by [lax1dude](https://github.com/lax1dude)

## How do I use this?
Basically, fork it, and then press the big Run button on Replit, and it will run your very own EaglercraftX (Eaglercraft 1.8) server!

## What is it doing?
It is probably compiling the latest, updated client for you. This may take a while (~15 minutes, maybe more)

## How do I switch between consoles? / Console help
Simply click on the console you want to type in. Alternatively, press `CTRL+B`, release, then press `;`.

To jump back to the bottom after scrolling, press `q`.

To select text for copying, hold shift, and then click and drag.

## How do I customize the server name?
Go into the `web/` folder and click on the [eaglercraft_opts.js](web/eaglercraft_opts.js) file. Everything from default language, to default servers (and names!), to website title and icon, to default server to join on page load; can all be customized in this file.

## How do I make custom textures?
With our new-and-improved **EagTek:tm:** 2.0 technology, you can now use vanilla 1.8 resource packs in your client. *(Alternatively, to change the default textures, and without using server resource packs (which also work :D), you can still customize the .epk file using my [web-based tool](https://ayunami2000.github.io/ayunWebEPK))*

## How do I keep people from logging in as me?
Use a plugin like [AuthMeReloaded](https://github.com/AuthMe/AuthMeReloaded/releases) to secure your and your player's accounts. **Note: For this to be usable, you must set `maxRegPerIp` to `0`.**

## Where can I find plugins?
- [Spigot Plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/)
- [Bukkit Plugins](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins)
- [Cuberite Plugins](https://plugins.cuberite.org)

## How do I change server software?
Included is a convenient little script that allows you to switch server software. Simply go to the **Shell** tab and type `./selsrv.sh`. Then, select one of the server software choices, and it will be applied! **NOTICE: Ensure you have stopped your server before running this script.**

## I'm having another issue.
Join the community-powered [Eaglercraft subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/eaglercraft/) to report it! **Be sure to read through other posts to see if it has already been reported, and, rather than reposting it, upvote the other post instead!**

## Can I DM you?
No.

## Where is singleplayer?
Don't get your hopes up; it's probably not gonna happen.

## Mods?
Do it yourself; they will not be provided.

## Can you join my server?
No.

## *Did* you join my server?
Probably not, it was probably someone pretending to be me.

## What if I don't want the client, and only the server?
Someone else will make that I'm sure. You can also go put it on the subreddit and if it gets enough upvotes I'll make an official one.
